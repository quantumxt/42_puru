## Zig

### Installation

Install zig via the snap package manager. (Ubuntu)

```bash
snap install zig --classic --edges
```

We would be using the git `master` build, more information is available [here](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Install-Zig-from-a-Package-Managers).



### Compilation

Use `zig build-exe`  to build the executable.

```bash
zig build <source_file>
```

For example, if the source file is a.zig:

```bash
zig build-exe a.zig
```

Both the `.o` and executable file would be generated after the compilation has been complete. 



### Running

The executable could the be executed:

```
./a
```
